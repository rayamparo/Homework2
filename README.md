# Homework2

This was much more time consuming than I imagined it would be. I looked up many different things to ensure that the homework came out the way I wanted it to. I have linked my own css stylesheet to all three html files in order to style the colors and change the margins for each page. For the most part I used the same card, navbar and footer for all three html files. I then changed the margins for each one to fit the size of the page the way I wanted them to. Other than that, each page is nearly indentical and the only changes made within each html file is how many rows and columns were used.  My "About Me" page was plain and simple, I used one row for both my picture and first paragraph, while separating the two with two columns. The second paragraph on that page was one giant row and column. For my "Portfolio" page, it was very similar to my "About Me" page in which I used one row and two columns for each row of pictures. For my "Contact" page, I just copied and pasted a form from Bootstrap, but I also took code from other forms to add more rows into the message section of the card. One thing I had trouble with was making the website responsive. I tried looking up the code, but was confused by all of the results that came up on Google.
